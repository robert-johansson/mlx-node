/**
 * SessionRegistry -- per-model cache holding AT MOST one live
 * `ChatSession` whose native KV state is currently valid.
 *
 * **Tier-2 `prompt_cache_key` reuse is ON by default** so the server
 * is compatible with any stateless LLM agent that sends the full
 * conversation history each turn. The key is caller-controlled and
 * HMAC-scoped with a boot-time nonce (raw value never stored on the
 * entry), but two clients that pick the same raw key will still
 * lease the same warm session — a session-hijack surface in
 * multi-tenant settings. For multi-tenant deployments, opt out via
 * `MLX_DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHE_KEY=1` or front the server with an auth
 * proxy that rewrites or namespaces `prompt_cache_key` per tenant
 * before it reaches this process. See also the comments on
 * {@link scopePromptCacheKey}.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 *   - **One registry per model.** Composed alongside each registered
 *     `ServableModel` in `ModelRegistry`. Sessions are keyed purely
 *     by response id — no secondary keying on model name because the
 *     registry is already scoped per model.
 *
 *   - **Single-warm-session invariant.** `ChatSession<M>` is a thin
 *     JS wrapper — it does NOT own any native KV cache. The cache
 *     lives on the underlying `SessionCapableModel` (one shared
 *     `cached_token_history` / `caches` vector per model instance).
 *     Any call that runs a turn overwrites that shared native state,
 *     silently invalidating every other `ChatSession` wrapper
 *     pointing at the same model. Caching multiple wrappers per
 *     model is therefore an illusion: at most ONE matches real
 *     native state (whichever ran most recently). To prevent
 *     cross-session corruption this registry holds at most ONE
 *     entry — both `getOrCreate` and `adopt` clear the map before
 *     returning or inserting.
 *
 *   - **Lease semantics on hit.** Clear-on-hit also gives single-
 *     flight lease semantics: two overlapping requests referencing
 *     the same `previous_response_id` cannot share the same live
 *     `ChatSession`. The first wins the cleared entry; the second
 *     finds the map empty and cold-replays from `ResponseStore` on
 *     a fresh session. Without this, the second would hit
 *     `ChatSession`'s single-flight "concurrent send() not allowed"
 *     guard.
 *
 *   - **Instructions / prefix-state change also misses.** Each entry
 *     records the `instructions` string used to adopt it.
 *     `getOrCreate` compares the caller's `requestedInstructions`
 *     against the cached value; mismatch forces cold replay so the
 *     new prefix state is re-primed instead of silently reusing a
 *     stale warmed prompt. The OpenAI `instructions` field and the
 *     Anthropic `system` field both flow through the same parameter
 *     — the registry does not care which is which.
 *
 *   - **Cache miss fallback.** On a miss (eviction, interleaved turn
 *     on a different chain, restart, lease-on-hit) the endpoint
 *     layer reconstructs the conversation from the `ResponseStore`
 *     history, primes a fresh `ChatSession` via `primeHistory()`,
 *     and resumes through `startFromHistory()` /
 *     `startFromHistoryStream()`. That pair dispatches one
 *     `chatSessionStart*` call that rebuilds the full KV cache and
 *     atomically appends the new user turn, so cold replay is
 *     indistinguishable from a hot hit.
 *
 *   - **TTL.** Default 1800 seconds mirrors `RESPONSE_TTL_SECONDS`
 *     in `packages/server/src/endpoints/responses.ts` so the cached
 *     entry ages out alongside its stored response metadata. With
 *     at most one entry there is no LRU bookkeeping — just a single
 *     expiry check on lookup.
 *
 *   - **Thread safety.** Node.js is single-threaded within one
 *     event-loop tick, so the internal `Map` is safe against
 *     concurrent mutation by design. `sweep()` can be scheduled
 *     via `setInterval` without colliding with in-flight calls.
 *
 *   - **Per-model execution mutex.** A dispatch that spans multiple
 *     awaits (map -> prefill -> decode -> persist -> adopt) is NOT
 *     atomic from the registry's POV. Two requests against the
 *     same model would both receive a `ChatSession` pointing at
 *     the same native model; even though the lease-on-hit clear
 *     prevents sharing one `ChatSession` object, the native KV
 *     cache is a single mutable resource and two parallel
 *     `primeHistory()` / `send*()` calls would race. Whichever
 *     finished last would win `adopt()`, poisoning the hot path
 *     for every subsequent chained turn.
 *
 *     `withExclusive(fn)` serializes every per-model dispatch via
 *     a FIFO `execLock` chain. `/v1/responses` and `/v1/messages`
 *     wrap the full `getOrCreate -> run -> adopt/drop` span in one
 *     `withExclusive` so at most one request holds the model at a
 *     time. A weaker epoch-token scheme would let the losing
 *     `adopt()` no-op but the native KV would already be wrong.

   *      chain. Cold-replay is the safe default.
   *
   *   2. **Tier 2 — `promptCacheKey`.** Only runs when
   *      `previousResponseId` is `null`. Stateless agent clients
   *      (pi-mono, Aider, Codex CLI, Continue, etc.) never use

   *      (same single-use semantics as tier 1). On a miss, fall

  /**
   * @deprecated **Redundant on `/v1/messages` for paged-active models.**
   * Phase 7 of the messages-kv-reuse plan removed the only call site
   * for paged-active full-attention models (Qwen3 + LFM2 + Gemma4
   * today): the native block-paged KV adapter (`PagedKVCacheAdapter` +
   * `BlockAllocator` + `LayerKVPool`) recovers a turn's prefix from
   * refcounted KV blocks keyed by token-prefix hash, so the JS-side
   * single-warm slot this method walks is redundant — the native
   * cache picks up the same cross-turn reuse without the
   * byte-equal-`instructions` gate, and additionally supports
   * cross-conversation prefix sharing the warm slot cannot.
   *
   * The `/v1/messages` endpoint now branches at request time on
   * {@link SessionCapableModel.hasBlockPagedCache}: paged-active models
   * call {@link SessionRegistry.createFreshSession} per request and
   * never touch the warm slot; non-paged models (Qwen3.5 dense + MoE —
   * default-OFF pending a perf decision; the `QianfanOCRModel` VLM —
   * no adapter wired) still call this method because the JS-side warm
   * slot is the ONLY cross-conversation reuse mechanism available to
   * them. Removing this method would silently disable cross-turn reuse
   * on every non-paged model, so it stays load-bearing until ALL
   * session-capable models have paged enabled by default. Treat
   * `@deprecated` as an intent signal that paged-active callers should
   * use `createFreshSession` instead.
   *
   * Third lookup mode — for STATELESS full-history endpoints that have
   * no `previous_response_id` to thread and do not propagate
   * `prompt_cache_key` back to the server. The Anthropic
   * `/v1/messages` endpoint is the canonical caller: clients (e.g.
   * Claude Code) POST the entire conversation each turn, so the only
   * remaining signal that a turn N continues turn N-1's prefix is the
   * registry's own warm slot.
   *
   * Behaviour: walk the registry's at-most-one warm entry. If it is
   * non-expired AND its stored `instructions` are byte-equal to
   * `requestedInstructions`, lease it out (single-use — `entries.clear()`
   * before return, mirroring the tier-1 / tier-2 lease-on-hit
   * semantics). Otherwise clear the map and return a fresh session.
   *
   * Crucially, this lookup IGNORES `entry.promptCacheKey` and ignores
   * the entry's prior `previousResponseId` keying — any warm slot is
   * fair game for `/v1/messages` reuse. The byte-equal `instructions`
   * compare is the SOLE correctness gate: a system prompt change
   * forces cold replay so the new prefix state is re-primed instead
   * of silently reusing a stale warmed prompt.
   *
   * **Adoption sentinel.** `/v1/messages` adopts back under the literal
   * sentinel id `'__msg_warm__'`. That sentinel will never appear as a
   * `previous_response_id` on a `/v1/responses` request — the
   * Anthropic Messages API does not produce a `previous_response_id`
   * value clients could echo back, and the OpenAI side mints fresh
   * `resp_*` ids — so cross-endpoint capture via tier-1 is impossible
   * by construction. The two endpoints still SHARE the single warm
   * slot under the registry's single-warm invariant: a
   * `/v1/messages` turn that follows a `/v1/responses` turn can evict
   * (and vice versa). That is the explicit trade-off of holding at
   * most one warm entry per model.
   *
   * **Trust model.** Multi-tenant isolation on this endpoint requires
   * fronting the server with an auth proxy that scopes warm-slot
   * visibility per tenant — same trust boundary documented at the top
   * of this file for the tier-2 `prompt_cache_key` path. The single-
   * warm invariant plus `withExclusive`'s per-model serialization make
   * the lookup safe under SINGLE-tenant assumptions: no two requests
   * race the slot, and there is at most one slot to lease.
   *
   * **Caller contract on miss.** If `instructions` drifts between
   * turns (system prompt changed) this returns `hit: false` and a
   * fresh session — and the caller MUST then run a full
   * `session.reset()` before priming history, NOT the JS-only
   * `resetPreservingNativeCacheForWarmReuse` path. A fresh JS session
   * does NOT imply a fresh native cache (the underlying
   * `SessionCapableModel` is shared and its native
   * `cached_token_history` persists across requests), so skipping the
   * native wipe on a miss would let the next `chatSessionStart` reuse
   * an unrelated previous request's prefix — the cross-request
   * cache-affinity side channel that the long block comment in
   * `responses.ts` (around the `runSessionNonStreaming` /
   * `runSessionStreaming` branches) describes.
   */
  /**
   * Allocate a fresh `ChatSession` bound to this registry's model
   * without touching the warm slot. Intended for the `/v1/messages`
   * endpoint when the underlying model has a block-paged KV cache
   * active: the native cache already reuses SYS blocks across requests
   * via content-addressing in `BlockAllocator`'s prefix-hash table, so
   * the JS-side warm slot in
   * {@link SessionRegistry.getOrCreateWarmAny} is redundant.
   *
   * Crucially, this call is purely additive — it does **NOT** clear,
   * read, or evict the warm slot. Two parallel `/v1/messages` requests
   * sharing a system prompt both call `createFreshSession` and both
   * get distinct sessions; the native cache transparently refcounts
   * the shared SYS blocks across them. This is the routing decision
   * the long block comment in `packages/server/src/endpoints/messages.ts`
   * documents: paged → fresh session, non-paged → warm-any lookup.
   *
   * The returned session is pre-seeded with the operator-configured
   * `samplingDefaults` (matching every other cache-miss branch) so a
   * client that picks the paged path does not silently stray from the
   * server's pinned sampling knobs.
   *
   * Returned with `hit: false` to keep the result shape uniform with
   * {@link SessionRegistry.getOrCreate} and
   * {@link SessionRegistry.getOrCreateWarmAny}; callers that care
   * about the cache header semantics should observe
